It forms a complex with TIPIN that influences CHEK1 phosphorylation and affects the intra-S phase checkpoint response to genotoxic stress. On the other hand, PANK2 is a key enzyme in CoA biosynthesis, converting pantothenate (Vitamin B5) to 4'-phosphopantothenate, the first step in the CoA biosynthetic pathway. CoA is essential for fatty acid synthesis and energy production, processes that are upregulated in rapidly proliferating cells, including cancer cells, to meet increased metabolic demands. A potential interaction between TIMELESS and PANK2 can be hypothesized based on the premise that DNA replication and repair processes consume significant cellular energy. Therefore, the regulation of CoA biosynthesis by PANK2 could indirectly affect the functionality of TIMELESS in maintaining genome integrity. In cancer cells, where metabolic pathways are reprogrammed for rapid growth and proliferation, an efficient CoA production might be crucial for supporting enhanced DNA replication and repair activities mediated by TIMELESS. This interaction may not directly involve physical binding between TIMELESS and PANK2 but rather represents a functional linkage where PANK2-mediated CoA biosynthesis supports the energy-demanding processes of DNA repair and replication fork stability controlled by TIMELESS. The interaction hypothesis is grounded on their respective roles in critical cellular processes, suggesting that any disruption in CoA biosynthesis might indirectly impair the DNA repair and replication functions of TIMELESS, potentially contributing to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer.",

Its function is critical during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, where it aids in the disentanglement of DNA to ensure error-free DNA replication and separation of sister chromatids. Furthermore, TOP2A's involvement in DNA damage response pathways underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability. TEX10, although less characterized in terms of its molecular interactions, is part of the Five Friends of Methylated CHTOP (5FMC) complex and plays a role in rRNA maturation and pre-60S ribosomal subunit nucleoplasmic transit, indicating its involvement in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and, implicitly, protein synthesis.

It interacts with various components including sortilin (SORT1) to mediate its endocytosis, as well as with CTSD (cathepsin D) to maintain its peptidase activity which is crucial for lysosomal function. CD14 acts as a co-receptor for the detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), initiating a signaling cascade leading to NF-kappa-B activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Given the roles of GRN in inflammation and tissue repair, and those of CD14 in innate immunity, a potential functional interaction between these genes could arise in the context of cancer where inflammatory processes and immune responses play critical roles. The interaction might involve GRN modulating the inflammatory response mediated by CD14, possibly affecting the clearance of pathogens or damaged cells, and influencing tumor microenvironment or anti-tumor immune responses. Experimental evidence supporting a direct or indirect interaction could involve observing changes in inflammatory or immune response markers when both GRN and CD14 are manipulated, or identifying physical or regulatory interactions between pathways involving GRN and CD14 in the context of cancer.",
