FBXO7, through its role in the complex, recognizes and ubiquitinates specific substrates for degradation, thereby regulating their levels within the cell. RFX5, on the other hand, is a transcription factor that activates the transcription from class II MHC promoters by recognizing X-boxes, a critical function for the immune response and antigen presentation. Although there is no direct, known physical interaction between FBXO7 and RFX5, it can be hypothesized that through its action in protein degradation pathways, FBXO7 could indirectly affect the levels of co-factors or inhibit proteins that are essential for RFX5's function in transcriptional activation of MHC II genes. If specific substrates of FBXO7 are involved in negatively regulating RFX5 activity or stability, the ubiquitination and degradation of these substrates could enhance RFX5-mediated transcription, potentially influencing immune responses or developmental processes related to MHC II expression. Conversely, if FBXO7 targets proteins that stabilize or facilitate RFX5 activity for degradation, its action might result in lowered MHC II gene expression, illustrating a complex potential regulatory mechanism where FBXO7 indirectly modulates the availability or activity of RFX5 via ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathways.
